# AutoBot -NLP Based Chatbot

This project is a rule-based chatbot designed to interact with users regarding car-related queries. The chatbot is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and is capable of recognizing the intent of the userâ€™s query. Once the intent is classified, the bot retrieves relevant information about specific car models from a pre-built dataset stored in a JSON file.

# Features

- **Intent Classification**: The chatbot classifies user queries based on their intent, allowing for more structured and accurate responses.
- **Car Model Recognition**: The bot can recognize the name of a car in the user's query and fetch specific details about the car.
- **Prebuilt Responses**: The bot retrieves pre-defined responses based on the recognized intent, making the interaction quick and efficient.
- **JSON File Integration**: Car details, such as model specifications, features, and prices, are stored in a JSON file for easy access and scalability.

# How It Works

1. **User Query**: The user inputs a query related to a car.
2. **Intent Classification**: The chatbot processes the query to classify its intent (e.g., information request, comparison, features, etc.).
3. **Car Name Recognition**: The chatbot identifies the name of the car mentioned in the query.
4. **Data Retrieval**: Once the intent and car name are recognized, the chatbot searches for the relevant information in the JSON file and returns a prebuilt response.
   
# Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for building the chatbot.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques such as tokenization, intent classification, and named entity recognition (NER) are used.
- **JSON**: Data about different car models is stored in a JSON file to facilitate easy access.
- **Libraries/Tools**:
  - nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) for NLP tasks.
  - scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms (if you are using any classifier).
  - json for parsing the car details JSON file.
